# todo_site_using_django
A todo site is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their to-do lists. It can be a simple tool for keeping track of small tasks, or it can be a more complex system with features such as due dates, priorities, and tags.

A todo site can be built using Django, a Python web framework. Django is a popular choice for building web applications because it is easy to learn and use, and it provides a lot of features out of the box.

To build a todo site using Django, you will need to:

Create a Django project.
Create a Django app for your todo list.
Define the models for your todo list.
Create the views for your todo list.
Create the templates for your todo list.
Configure the Django settings for your todo list.
Once you have completed these steps, you will have a basic todo site that you can customize to meet your needs.

Here are some additional features that you can add to your todo site:

Authentication and authorization: Allow users to create accounts and log in to their accounts.
Sorting and filtering: Allow users to sort and filter their to-do lists.
Notifications: Send notifications to users when their to-do items are due.
Integration with other services: Integrate your todo site with other services, such as Google Calendar or Slack.
I hope this gives you a brief overview of how to build a todo site using Django. If you are interested in learning more, there are many resources available online.
